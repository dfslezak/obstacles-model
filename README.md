# Obstacles Model

The obstacles model is a a theory of decision-making in the presence of multiple choices which incorporates entropic barriers in a stochastic search process. 

The model generates RT distributions in highly efficient way, which fits not just the mean and variance, but the entire response time distribution (over several response-time orders of magnitude) in multiple-alternative decision making. The model can be seen as a synergy between diffusion models used to model simple two-choice decision-making and planning agents in complex problem solving.
